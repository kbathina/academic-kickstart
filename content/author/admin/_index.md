I love solving complex problems through exploratory data analysis. I believe looking at the data and methods from various interdisciplinary angles is the best way to come up with an optimal solution. It is like solving a puzzle; you canâ€™t start building from a corner one piece at a time. You need to assemble individual components and then combine them together.
