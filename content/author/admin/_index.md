I love solving complex problems through exploratory data analysis. I believe looking at the data and methods from various interdisciplinary angles is the best way to come up with an optimal solution. It is like solving a puzzle; you canâ€™t start building from a corner one piece at a time. You need to assemble individual components and then combine them together.

I am a finishing Ph.D. data scientist at Indiana University at the School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering. My thesis work is about the resilience of complex systems to shocks, involving large datasets from social media and human interaction. Throughout my schooling, I have picked up many quantitative skills such as Python, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the field, I have also worked with interviews, surveys, and other qualitative research techniques. Most importantly, I have managed projects with large, diverse teams. I am skilled at initiating complicated projects while effectively communicating and organizing with my team to keep on track towards project completion. I possess strong abilities to research new techniques/solutions and explain findings to collaborators and colleagues.
