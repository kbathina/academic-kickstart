I am a 5th year PhD student at Indiana University studying Complex Systems. I am currently working with Drs. Johan Bollen and Filippo Radicchi. My thesis broadly revolves around patterns during phase transitions. 

I am currently working on a python implementation (with code and explanation) of Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial Introduction with R by Dr. John Kruschke. The current (unfinished) working website is linked [here](https://pydbda.github.io/dbda-notes/).
