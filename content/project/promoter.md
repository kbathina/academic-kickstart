Using 500+ inbred lines of D. Melanogaster, we look at the differences around the neighborhood of Transcriptrion Start Sites (TSS). Using nucleotide diversity, or the average number of nucleotide differences per site between DNA sequences, we attempt to calculate a value for its heterozygosity. Initial results show much higher diversity around TSSs when compared to exons and introns. We are currently searching for patterns of nucleotide diversity by distance from the TSS, among different types of promoters, and among different organisms.
